      <i>The newly built environment in Switzerland reflects the vocabulary through which it is communicated. That is a vocabulary which makes itself independent in today's architectural discourse and which, unquestioned, represents our ideals and standards. It contains words which have only positive connotations and are used as complements, although they contradict each other in their true meaning. Without raised questions, they are stretchy, versatile and seem to rather be a reflection of morality and values ​​of its user than its confrontation with architecture. Through their use, these words are completely stripped of their importance and became degenerated platitudes and projections for diffuse hopes. This autonomous, adaptive vocabulary simultaneously sets the directives in the development process of architecture. In this way, it becomes the reasoning basis for dialogue in the Swiss culture of consensus. In the tension between architects, planners, private investors and the public sector this consensus manifests itself as agreement and approval, where dissent and diversity are perceived as disruptive, which is consistent with a lack of resistance. The built consequence of this consensus is an architecture of compromise - because while none of the parties revolts on the way to this agreement, the cutbacks fall back solely on the architecture. The enfeebled idea loses all ability to make its statement, critical question or a political attitude clear and understandable. The final product and its compatibility stand over its content and the fear of the unknown triumphs over curiosity. Extra effort would have to be demanded from architects for courage, ingenuity and criticism, in order to oppose the absurdity and arbitrariness in the process of making architecture, dried up under the pressure of the economy, the dependency on the inter-disciplinary circus, the social norm and its own self-centered pursuit of success. If architecture becomes pure fulfilment of requirements, rooted in an unreflected, undifferentiated vocabulary, without possessing a coherent whole, then the compromise becomes the enemy of every idea. We must obtain a precise vocabulary to discuss architecture in a critical way.
